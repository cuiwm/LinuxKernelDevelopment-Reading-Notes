Chatper 1: Introduction to the Linux Kernel
1.1 In the summer of 1969, Bell Lab programmers sketched out a filesystem design that ultimately evolved into Unix.
1.2 A handful of characteristics of Unix are at the core of its stength.
    First, Unix is simple. Only hundreds of system calls and have a straightforward, even basic, design.
    Second, in Unix, everything is a file.
    Third, written in C which gives Unix amazing portability to deverse hareware architectures and accessibility to 
    a wide range of developers.
    Fourth, fast process creation time the the unique fork() system call.
    Finally, enable the creation of simple programs that "do one thing and do it well".
    Unix exhibit clean layering, with a strong separation between policy and mechanism.
